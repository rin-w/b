### Introduction

The content of this article will contain information about playing, creating,
and making a video of Black MIDIs which can be published to any host service
for sharing. There are several common ways; for this tutorial, it will mainly
instruct for users of either two operating systems (*Windows* and *Android*).
For users of other operating systems, git gud so any of the steps below would
be fairly easy to translate to your own operating system to achieve virtually
the same thing (so long as compatible applications are available).

It is also important to know what the [genre][g] is about, and what [MIDI][m]
is. You don't necessarily need to know about MIDI and Black MIDI in a deep
manner; a simple surface scratching will do in order to much more properly
understand what this tutorial will be trying to make you do in your computer.

::: warning Safety check

All third party programs mentioned in the following articles are very well
known to not do any malicious harm to your computer. Do beware of the license
agreement for each of them.

I am also obviously not liable if you somehow get a toaster stuck in your butt
while following this tutorial.
