# How to make Black MIDIs

The steps below only cover about exporting a newly created composition you
want to create to a MIDI file. This does not talk about in-depth musical
composition and theoretical analysis and application of the genre. For that,
you may head [here](#ohgod).

## Download a MIDI editor {data-step="1"}

Firstly, find a space within your computer (hard drive) where you have at
least a gigabyte to spare. But if you can't, then maybe at least spare 10
megabytes to be able to use a MIDI editor.

::: details *Domino* (Windows, freeware, [English (v1.43)][dome]; [Japanese (v1.44)][doms] x86 (stable); [Japanese (v1.45)][doml], x64 (beta))

Currently the fastest and lightweight freeware MIDI editor known to man.
Its user interface looks like the classic 
[Windows Forms appearance][wf]{title="because it is, and it's written in C++"}.
It features custom keybindings, nifty method of MIDI device integrations,
various piano roll tools and key scaling highlights, 
<i title="A single piano roll view of the note arrangements of multiple tracks">
Onion Skin</i>, etc. However, it refuses to load MIDIs that have multi-tracked
channels.[^w] It was originally in Japanese with unofficial translations
distributed from various sources of the web.

::: details [*REAPER*][reap] (Windows; macOS; GNU/Linux, freemium, proprietary)

A complete [DAW][daw]{title="Digital Audio Workstation"}
available with an evaluation license. Simply, imagine Domino, but it actually
produces audio by itself, can run [VSTs][vst]{title="Virtual Studio Technology"},
and has a dark theme that's <span title="Sorry Domino. You're just not that
sexy to me.">pleasing to the eyes</span>.[^c] Its advantage point is its music
notation editing layout.

:::

::: details [*FL Studio*][fl] (Windows; macOS, trial, proprietary)

Another complete DAW available with trial usage, which can also be used as a
MIDI editor.[^a][^b] Its advantage point is it has the best
[UX][ux]{title="User Experience"} among these three. Its piano roll
performance is also slightly more optimized than REAPER (with the older
version at least).

:::

::: details *FL Studio Mobile* ([Android][fla], [iOS][fli], proprietary)

It's FL Studio, but mobile, so it's implied there's some handicap and limits
to features such as the notorious tempo changes.

## Install the MIDI editor {data-step="2"}

To install the program you have picked, you either directly run the .exe file
directly, or run the installer for it. For Android, *Google Play Store*
and *App Store* will give provision on getting it to work on your
devices.

The next section contains links to detailed installation instructions for some
MIDI editors.

## Start blacking {data-step="3"}

You are almost done with setting things up and pretty much ready to go
blacking. To cap it off, here are some boosters to help you have a nice
experience when blacking MIDIs:

## Becoming the very best blacker in the world {data-step="4"}

[^!] There is no such thing as the best way to make a Black MIDI (at least as
what agreed upon). There are certain ways to black which a particular sum of
population find acceptable/satisfactory or 'of quality', that are very
loosely defined in the community. One notorious concept of blacking a MIDI
known as *Korean style* is heavily cited as 'quality' due to its author's
intricate attention to details when making it. What makes a Black
MIDI *Korean style* is already debatable, making every other Black MIDIs very
hard to categorize, and even if it is done so, it almost always meets a vague
criteria. The community would often say terminologies like *phrases*, but
what is a *phrase*? 

There are a lot of things to cover and question about crafting a Black MIDI,
and making discussions about it often ends up with no concrete conclusions,
but filled with valid learnings which helps a lot in improving blacking
skills. With that said, here are some articles about making Black MIDIs:

## Footnotes

[^!]: This section should be improved.

[^a]: 

    FL Studio is significantly less performant than Domino, especially as its
    version increases.

[^b]: 

    FL Studio cannot have multiple time signature markers on its piano roll
    prior version 20.

[^c]: 

    REAPER is significantly less performant than Domino, especially as more
    layers of notes are on the screen.

[^w]: 

    You may use <a href="/soft/fofbad">fof-bad</a> to split tracks containing
    notes from multiple channels.
