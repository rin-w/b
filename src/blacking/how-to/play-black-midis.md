# How to play Black MIDIs

Usually, a Black MIDI is played on MIDI players for an optimized playback
performance and visual pleasure. Apart from "usually", I have no clue what
dark/enigmatic stories they offer.

## Download a MIDI player {data-step="1"}

You have a variety of other selections, but here are the popular ones and my
recommendations: 

::: details *Piano From Above* (Windows, open-source, [latest][pfa-l], [forked][pfa-f])

The most commonly used visual MIDI player for Black MIDIs, from piano
tutorials to benchmarking multi-bajillion notes just to see their computers
*lag*. Originally closed-source, PFA was conceived by Brian Pantano as a
concept of playing one's piano with easy to follow visuals. It was easy until
blackers started using it. Forks of the program were released with further
performance optimizations.

:::

::: details [*Synthesia*][synthe] (Windows (v9, freeware); macOS (v9, freeware); Android; iPad; all freemium)

Another visual MIDI player one will usually see on piano tutorial videos with
similar features as PFA, is to no surprise, also used as a Black MIDI visual
player. It is usually used over PFA for its distinct visual
appearance.[^f]

:::

::: details [*TMIDI*][tmidi] (Windows, open-source)

A fairly simple MIDI player with minimal visuals.

:::

::: details [*Kiva*][kiva] (Windows, open-source)

Aimed to replace Piano From Above once and for all, it was conceived by
Arduano, dedicated to play Black MIDIs in a way more performant manner.

:::

::: details [*Chikara*][chikar] (Windows, open-source)

Another goddamn visual MIDI player developed only for humongus Black MIDIs
aiming to take advantage of multithreading further to juice down one\'s CPU
with absolutely no room left for it to breathe. 

:::

::: details *MIDI Voyager*{#mv} ([Android][mv-a], [iOS][mv-i][^g], proprietary)

An ugly but performant visual MIDI player.

## Install the MIDI player {data-step="2"}

To install the program you have picked, you either directly run the .exe file
directly, or run the installer for it. For mobile devices, *Google Play
Store* and *App Store* will give provision on getting it to work on your
devices.

Here are some detailed instructions for some of the listed programs:

## Play a MIDI in the player {data-step="3"}

After you manage to open the player, find and open a MIDI file of your choice.
Each MIDI player has its own way of opening MIDI files, but here are some
detailed instructions for some:

## Enhance sound {data-step="4"}

Now, you might notice the sound of the Black MIDI you are hearing is either
poor or non-existent at all. This is where you should know
about *synthesizers* to alleviate that problem. For starters, a synthesizer
is a software instrument that makes the digital sound. In comparison to a
MIDI player and a MIDI file, the MIDI player reads the MIDI file while the
synthesizer just follows and makes sound based on what the MIDI player is
reading on command. You might ask 'Why can't the synthesizer just play the
MIDI file by itself?' Well, some synthesizers do that, but this mechanism was
on purpose so MIDI players can read a particular MIDI file for multiple
synthesizers, synchronously.

For Windows, there is already a bundled software synthesizer when it is
installed on your computer, however, this is not customizable to your
desired *soundfont*, nor does it support more polyphony.

You have a lot of choices for a MIDI synthesizer (including hardware
synthesizers), but the most commonly used as a software synth engine is
[bassmidi][bass]. The first two are some implementations of it:

#### Downloads

::: details [*Keppy's Synthesizer*][kepys] (Windows, x64)

The most commonly used software synthesizer among blackers, and a dedicated
Black MIDI synthesizer.

:::

::: details [*VirtualMIDISynth*][vms] (Windows)

A stable software synth that works on a handful kinds of Black MIDIs.

:::

::: details [*MIDI Voyager*](#mv)

This program has its own soundfont player that's used as you play a MIDI.
(Links mentioned above)

To install the program you have picked, you either directly run the .exe file
directly, or complete the installer for it first. 

Here are some detailed instructions for some of the listed programs: 

- [How to install Keppy's Synthesizer on Windows](/software/synthesizer/keppy-synth.html#installation)
- [VirtualMIDISynth Setup Tutorial][vms-tutorial]

Next thing you would want to do is to change how it sounds overall. The
biggest factor for this is the *soundfont*. These files are usually named as
<code>\*.sf2</code> or <code>\*.sfz</code>. You can either download an already
existing soundfont, or <a href="meth">make one yourself</a>. For beginners,
here are some sites where you can quickly get a soundfont:

- [MBMS' soundfont repositories][mbms]
- [Soundfonts 4U][s4u]
- [Musical Artifacts][ma]
- [Musescore][ms]

After you have setup your software synth, you can now configure your MIDI
player to use it.
