*~~Keppy's <s style="text-decoration-style: wavy;">Driver</s> Synthesizer~~
OmniMIDI* is a software synthesizer for the Microsoft Windows operating
system.

:::

## Installation

#### Download {data-step="1"}

Currently, there is one main source to acquire this divine musical equipment:

- [GitHub][gh] (Windows, open-source, latest)

The first listed `.exe` file should be the setup file which we need to run.

#### Install {data-step="2"}

Upon running the setup file, it will require you to give it administrative
privilege so it could access the system files where it will plant a file that
will allow you to play MIDIs with sound later on. At this point, you have to
say yes as it's too late to say no anymore.

The setup will then tell you about the licence agreement when using the
software. You must read and agree to all of it wholeheartedly as it is the
introductory testament to your acceptance and obedience to the divine
program's commandments you asked for. While reading, you must use your two
fingers on the right hand to press on your right ear (symbol and meditation
of hearing protection increases resistance to tinnitus) and raise your left
hand with the fingers forming an ok hand that looks like a letter "k"
(initials of keppy and kspaghetti). (DO NOT MAKE A MISTAKE OR
MISPRONUNCIATION WHILE READING)

The next step is about finalizing your commitment to the divine program.

After you click the 'Finish' button, Keppy's Driver should now be by your side
forever. Should you feel troubled, it will comfort you and enlighten you what
to conduct.


## Configuration

To run the configuration window, simply head to the start menu and find
Keppy's Driver folder, where the shortcut for it exists.

### Managing Soundfonts

#### Adding soundfonts

When you want to add a soundfont, just click the plus button or drag and drop
the soundfont file from the file explorer.

![keppy synth config pointed at button for adding soundfont](/kepysynth_addsf.webp)

#### Toggling soundfonts

You can toggle the soundfont using green red buttons.

![keppy synth config pointed at soundfont toggle buttons](/kepysynth_togglesf.webp)

The refresh button above it can be used to push a state update on what
soundfonts the currently running MIDI players listening to the synth should
play. For example, if you have a MIDI player that loaded the list with
soundfont A toggled on and soundfont B toggled off, and then you toggle on
the soundfont B, you will only be able to hear soundfont B on that player
after you click the refresh button. If you want it to automatically push a
state update whenever you toggle a soundfont, you can enable this behaviour
through the menu:

![keppy synth config auto reload soundfonts menu](/kepysynth_autoreload.webp)

#### Soundfont list assignment per application

You can assign an application to what specific list number it should load the
soundfonts from.

![keppy synth config per app soundfont list assignment toggle menu](/kepysynth_sflistassign.webp)

On the next window that appears select which list the application/s will load
from, then right-click anywhere on the white background for the options to
appear.

![keppy synth config per app soundfont list assignment window](/kepysynth_sflistassignwindow.webp)

`Absolute path` means the synth will recognize the app through the location of
the app. The second option means the synth will recognize the app by its name
alone, but in any location it is.


### Quick optimizations

These are some experience improvements when using the synth.

#### LoudMax (audio compressor)

If you hear dank noises (or cracking noises) at sound peaks, you could install
LoudMax to the synth. LoudMax is an audio compressor which is useful for
normalizing extreme sound output especially from Black MIDIs.

![keppy synth config loudmax menu](/kepysynth_loudmax.webp)

#### WinMM patch

You can apply a patch to any other application that makes use of Keppy's
Synthesizer. This can yield slightly better playback performance. However, if
issues are encountered, you can also revert it back. Furthermore, you could
always ask for help from the community to possibly solve issues with your
program.

![keppy synth config winmm patch menu](/kepysynth_winmm.webp)

#### Hotkey for sound resetting

An option to let you use the `Insert` key on your keyboard to cut and reset
all MIDI events at one point in time is available. This can be handy if some
channels somehow get their sustain events stuck (or any other events).

![keppy synth config hotkey toggle](/kepysynth_hotkey.webp)


## Advanced

You can change further settings of the synth for playback optimization or
experimentation. There are also some available presets to choose from
according to your needs.

![keppy synth config showing advanced configuration options](/kepysynth_settings.webp)

The `Audio engine` is the engine for the audio. Currently, WASAPI is the most
efficient audio engine of the synth. You may change it if you are having
issues with other engines.


Each checkbox will create some form of performance degradation when toggled on,
but results in compromise in audio quality when toggled off
(especially interpolation, sequential note cut-offs, and sound effects).

The third checked box about the `sequential note cut-offs` means that when the
maximum voice count limit is reached, it will cut the sound of the note that
is still sustained, that is, the prioritized note to be cut off is
the "oldest instance" meaning whichever sustained note was the first to be
triggered at that moment.

::: details Elaboration about sequential note cut-offs

For example, if your maximum voice count is 3 for the figure below, the
violet note will get cut off when your playhead starts triggering the 4th
note. The blue note will get cut off next if your playhead reaches the 5th
note. Finally, if two notes with the same starting point triggers, two other
sustained notes at the same time must also get cut off if there are still 3
other notes playing.

:::

The biggest factor for getting black MIDI playback speed is the synth's
ability to cut as much voices as fast as it can. Setting an optimized `Driver
voice limit` of 1000 gives a reasonable room for you to hear enough of the
sound idea from a huge amount of notes playing. However, having a higher max
voice count means you will be able to hear as much sustained notes as
possible at every time, giving you an uninterrupted note fade offs.

`Maximum rendering time` is simply the ratio of the CPU usage allotted for the
synth. This is in accordance with voice limiting, where if a CPU usage of
100% is reached, but the synth couldn't keep up with the further increasing
voice count, the synth will just 'choke' and create distorted noises
signifying its despair from the overload. This ratio is there to
automatically enforce a voice limit (that can override the user-specified
voice limit) when a specified percent is reached by the CPU. For example, if
75% is the limit and 2000 is the user-specified voice limit, a CPU that can
only handle 1800 voices at 90% will be throttled, and will result in forced
voice limiting to around 1500.[^a]

`Driver audio frequency` has something to do with [sample rates][samp].
To simply put, a lower rate will result in slightly better playback
performance, but lower sound quality.

`Driver buffer length` has something to do with any [general application buffering][buff].
It is how much time the synth driver is given before playing the accumulated
sound play instructions. Very high values might give the playback
a 'quantized' sound.
