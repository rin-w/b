# Note Arrangement in *Domino*

## Quantize and Humanize

![domino quantize flipnote](/domino/quantizehumanize.webp)

The quantize tool automatically re-aligns notes that are off from the rhythm
even for a slight bit. It can be initialized by pressing `Ctrl` + `Q` or
through the menu -> `Event` -> `Quantize...`.

The humanize does the opposite of quantize. It randomizes the properties of
notes to make the arrangement sound "human". It can be accessed in the
menu -> `Event` -> `Humanize...`.

## Stretching and Flipping

A selection of notes can be stretched to a specified time. This option can be
accessed through the menu -> `Event` -> `Stretch...`. On this case, I made the
selection a half shorter:

![domino stretch window](/domino/stretch.webp)

Note that the stretching effect is applied to the boundaries of the selection
box, not the edges of the selected notes.

Notes in Domino can only be flipped horizontally through the menu ->
`Event` -> `Flip`.

## Harmonize

The harmonize function makes use of key scales to generate "harmony" from a
progression of single notes. It can be configured on the menu -> `Event` ->
`Miscellaneous` -> `Harmonize...` and applied to measures.

::: tip

The added Key Scale events can be edited in the Conductor track.

## Stroke

The stroke function applies incremental delays for each beginning of notes
from a chord. After selecting the chords, strokes can be applied through the
menu -> `Event` -> `Stroke...`.

## Pattern Slice

A pattern slice automates rhythmic slicing of notes or chords by applying a
pre-defined user pattern. To create or apply a pattern, simple go to the
menu -> `Event` -> `Pattern Slice...`.

We can demonstrate pattern registration by first creating a rhythm out of
notes:

![domino flip note](/domino/patternslice0.webp)

Note that the scope of note arrangement is limited to a single measure.
However, the notes can be on multiple keys as it only captures the starting
point and velocity of the notes.

Afterwards, we target the measure number where the arrangement is located and
register it:

![domino flip note](/domino/patternslice1.webp)

The pattern is saved and the original arrangement can now be deleted. The
following demonstrates the application of the created pattern:

The following file attached contains pre-defined patterns that you might find
useful for blacking MIDIs.

The patterns are saved in the `Domino\IniFiles\Dialog\PatternSlice.ini` file
and can be safely replaced with a different one. 

::: warning

Replacing the `PatternSlice.ini` file will remove existing user patterns.

## Linking Measures

The measure link event mirrors notes from a sequence of measures to another
within a track. It can be created through the menu -> `Insert` -> `Measure
Link`.

### Video Summary

- The source measure can be configured by double-clicking on the entry in the
  Event List. It can also be configured by changing the values on the Gate
  and Vel/Value column, which are measure starting point and transpose value,
  respectively
- The measure link event spans all subsequent measures containing no events.
- If the measure link destination ends too early, the End of Track (EOT) event
  can be manually placed on a later measure point past by the measure
  source's time.
