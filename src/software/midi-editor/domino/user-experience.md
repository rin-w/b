### Key Scale Highlight

Scale/Chord Highlight` or by clicking the colorful piano roll icon on the

### Onion Skin

#### Piano Roll

This features allows for viewing notes on a different track within the current
track view. It can be accessed on the menu -> `View` -> `Piano Roll` ->
`Onion Skin` -> `Overlay specific track...`.

On the track selection, you can select multiple tracks by holding `Ctrl` and
clicking the desired track to overlay. You can also select a sequence of
tracks by holding `Shift` then clicking from one track to another.

Alternatively, for quick toggling, you could enable the track panel on the
menu -> `View` -> `Track Selection Panel` and use it to toggle onion skin
view of different tracks:

A sample result is figured:

This feature is also available to graph panels and can be accessed through the
menu -> `View` -> `Graph Panel` -> `Onion Skin`.

Note that the data plot is restricted to the current track's data.

### Chord Inspect

The chord name preview below the piano bar is in limited correspondence to
what notes are on the current track:

Meanwhile, the chord inspect tool includes both the current track and onion
skin notes:

This option can be accessed on the menu -> `Playback` -> `Inspect Chord`. It
provides the chord name of the set of notes aligned to the playhead.


## Customization

### Toolbar Customization

All functions and options on the menu can be placed on toolbars for quick
access. It can be configured through the menu -> `View` -> `Toolbar` ->
`Customize...`.

For the demo above, the graphing resolution slider is added to the graph panel
toolbar.

### Hotkey Bindings

Binding keys to any function in the menus is straightforward. Simply click
the function listed and press the desired key to bind. On the following, I
typed `ABCDEFG` after clicking on `Lock steps`:

`Lock steps` will now trigger whenever I press any of the keys A, B, C, D, E,
F, or G during editing sessions.

Further, you could also modify mouse button behaviour under the `Mouse
Buttons` category:

![domino mouse buttons settings](/domino/mousebutt.webp)

The option selected above will change the behaviour of placing notes; the note
placed on click can be resized before releasing the click:

Even further, you could setup the function keys (e.g. `F1`, `F2` etc.) on your
keyboard to automatically set values of events in the Event List.

![domino mouse buttons settings](/domino/fnkeys.webp)

These values can be visually seen on the `Function Key Bar` which can be
toggled on the menu -> `View` -> `Function Key Bar`.

The functions can be triggered when you select a particular column value of an
event in the Event List, such as the `Gate` and `Vel/Value`.
