# The *Domino* MIDI Basics

This article will talk about fundamental operations in-depth from placing your
first note to exporting a MIDI file.

## Managing Tracks

The track list can be toggled by pressing the `Tab` button or the blue
spreadsheet icon at the top right. Alternatively, a track list side panel can
be toggled on the menu -> `View` -> `Track Selection Panel`, which will
always show on the left side. The position of this panel can be customized on
the Preferences window -> `General (pg. 1)` -> `Track Selection Panel
position`.

If you are using a sound source definition, creating a new project will give
you a template with 16 tracks already set up.

### Adding Multiple Tracks

If you want to add another set of 16 tracks and channel assignments, simply
right-click on any of the tracks then click on `Add track set...`

![domino adding track set on side panel](/domino/addtracks.webp)

The following prompt will appear asking you which channeled tracks should be
created:

![domino selecting track set port origin config](/domino/tracksetport.webp)

The tracks should be added right away afterwards.

### Adding a Single Track

Alternatively, if you only want to add a single track, choose `Add track`
instead on any track context menu.

With this, check if the track is pointed at the same port where the synth is,
by right-clicking on the new track -> `Track Properties...`. On this case,
the new track is pointed at port B, but we only have the synth at port A:

![domino track properties porting](/domino/porttrack.webp)

::: tip 

If doing this step every time to add a track is bothersome, you may set all
the ports to point to a single synth in the Preferences.

:::

You may set up the name of the track to keep track of it. The channel number
should also be setup correctly as you do not want CC event conflicts between
tracks.

The mode of the track only dictates what the piano roll should look like. It
does not completely tell the synth that it is a drum channel.

![domino track mode](/domino/trackmode.webp)

If `Rhythm` is toggled, that track will show the piano roll's keys as
percussion instrument names.

To change the channel into a drum or percussive channel, change the channel
number to 10.


## Piano Roll

### Placing Notes

![domino graph panel](/domino/notes.webp)

To place a note, just click on the desired position of the note on the
piano roll. You could also place one through the menu -> `Insert` -> `Note`
if you are keyboard savvy. 

Resize the notes by click-holding and dragging the right edge, or by adjusting
gate values in the [Event List](./misc#the-event-list).

To undo an action done, press `Ctrl` + `Z`. While `Ctrl` + `Y` can redo the
undoed action.

### Selection Box

![domino moving notes in piano roll](/domino/movenotes.webp)

To move a note, simply click hold and drag it. To move many notes, use the
selection tool (button with a dotted square outline icon) and make a
selection on the piano roll by click-holding and dragging over the desired
notes to move.

If you want to move that selection to another track, you can press `Ctrl` +
`C` to copy the selection first, then toggle the destination track and press
`Ctrl` + `V` to paste.

You can make multiple selection boxes by holding `Ctrl` before you make
another selection (and you can let go of `Ctrl` after clicking to keep the
grid snapping effect).

![domino piano roll multi selection](/domino/multiselect.webp)

To duplicate a selection, simply hold `Ctrl` then click hold and drag
the selection. This will make a duplicate of both the selection box and
notes, deselecting the other.

To remove notes, use the eraser tool. It acts like a selection tool except it
also deletes the notes. Alternatively, you can make a normal selection and
press the `Delete` key.

### Time Signatures and Quantization

The rhythmic signature can be changed by first clicking on where to place the
time signature, then inserting the event through the menu -> `Insert` ->
`Rhythmic Signature`. This event can be inspected on the Event List by
toggling the Conducter track first.

![domino graph panel](/domino/gridsnapsel.webp)

The above shows options on the division of the grid snap on the piano roll
when placing notes. Change this value depending on how precisely aligned the
notes and selection you want to make to the divisions of the rhythm.

While editing notes, you can hold `Ctrl` to deactivate quantization
temporarily for precise note placement.

### MIDI Hardware Recording

If you have a MIDI hardware, you can make use of it to arrange notes to the
piano roll as you play it. To configure this, press `Ctrl` + `R` or click the
record icon at the top center beside the time panel of Domino. 

More about MIDI recording is located in the [miscellaneous section](./misc#midi-recording).

## Graph Panel

The graph panel is where corresponding effect values applied to notes are
visualized. This mostly involves the note velocity and control changes
(CC) which create a particular sound effect.

![domino graph panel](/domino/graphsample.webp)

The stroke buttons at top of the graph panel cannot be used to draw the same
line forms right onto the piano roll and will take real effect only on the
graph panel itself. When used on the piano roll, it simply acts as a note
placer.

The following video showcases various graph panel use cases:

:::

### Video Summary

- You can enable draggable anchors to adjust individual graph points up or
  down
- You can isolate graph application on a specific selection. (applies only to
  Velocity)
- The graph resolution dictates how detailed the graph formation should be. A
  lower resolution results in a more blocky graph. This value can be adjusted
  through the arrow dropdown beside the line graph tool -> `Resolution...`.
- You can apply graph functions/expressions to a selection.
- Graphs can be restricted to the starting point of the parallel notes as the
  graph is applied. This can be enabled through the arrow dropdown beside the
  line graph tool -> `Anchor to notes only`.


## Playback

To start the playback, you could press `Space` or click the green play button
at the top of the window. You could press `Space` again to stop the playback.
You can also loop a selection of measures by enabling it on the menu ->
`Playback` -> `Loop` -> `Enable` or by clicking the blue cycle icon:

## MIDI File Operations

The file operations are located in the menu -> `File`.

![domino file menu](/domino/filemenu.webp)

### Saving projects

You can press `Ctrl` + `S` to quickly save your project (`.dms` file). If it's
the first time you are saving an unsaved progress, it will prompt you on
where to save the file.

Saving projects to `.dms` may not be suitable for extremely high note counts
as some experience loss of progress from saving to `.dms`. Although the same
can be said when it comes to exporting to MIDI right away.

### Exporting

Exporting to MIDI can be done by navigating the menu -> `File` -> `Export MIDI
as...`.

![domino export window](/domino/exportmidi.webp)

The difference between the two format numbers of the MIDI (or MIDI Types) will
not affect much playback performance. Format 0 is only suitable for MIDIs
that only have up to 1 track for each channel. Format 1 is suitable for all
cases unless compatibility issues arise.

::: tip

When exporting large amount of notes, you can disable note overlap warnings to
reduce rendering overhead. (`Preferences` -> `SMF` -> `Note overlap
warnings`)

:::

### Importing

To import MIDIs to Domino, you can drag and drop the MIDI file into the window
from File Explorer. You could also press `Ctrl` + `O` or navigating the
menu -> `File` -> `Open...`.

::: danger

The above steps will replace your current running project or session. Make
sure to save it first if it's important.

:::

![domino cc resolution prompt](/domino/ccresolve.webp)

The above prompt will appear asking whether to resolve/restore CC Macros.
Clicking `No` would not have much serious effect on the result and would
finish the import process faster. However, if the source MIDI has custom CCs
that are not common (such as KS' Fine Tune parameter), this analysis will be
helpful in resolving those CCs for proper event placement/plotting within
Domino.

#### Adding to existing project

To import an entire MIDI to your existing project, you have to open the source
MIDI on another Domino window first and export it as [Domino Parts](./misc#domino-parts)
file (`.dmp`).

If only a few parts of the source MIDI (e.g. from one track) needs to be
imported, you could alternatively keep your existing project opened, while
another Domino window is running where the source MIDI is also opened.

You can run another Domino window by running Domino again from the File
Explorer.

::: tip

This behaviour can be disabled in `Preferences` -> `General (pg. 1)` ->
`Prevent multiple instances of this program`.

:::

Then, open the source MIDI, and make a selection of notes or events to copy.
Press `Ctrl` + `C` then jump to your existing project, and press `Ctrl` + `V`
to paste.

You can keep repeating this process until all the parts needed are pasted to
the current project.
