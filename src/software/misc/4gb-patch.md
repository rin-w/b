# 4GB Patch

This program is intended to modify 32-bit Windows executable files for
allowing it to use more than 2GB of RAM. With this feature, bigger MIDI could
then be loaded by these kinds of applications. 

Meanwhile, 64-bit applications do not need this patch.

## Usage

To use this app, just simply run it. Then, file selector window will
immediately appear. From there, just choose a 32-bit application. It will
prompt you on the results of the patch.

## Sample use cases

### Piano From Above

This MIDI player used to only have a 32-bit release, so sadistic blackers
would use it to run bigger MIDI files than what was default. Now with the
open-source release bundled with 64-bit compatibility, this is no longer
necessary for most sadistic blackers.

### Domino MIDI Editor

The current stable versions of Domino only ever had 32-bit releases. However,
a beta version has been released which features 64-bit capabilities, so the
need for sadist to apply the patch to Domino will cease in the future.
