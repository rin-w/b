## Usage

To use this app, just simply run it. Then, a file selector window will immediately appear.

The first selection is your target MIDI. The second target is the output name of the resulting MIDI.

On the console window, the number inputted will be the note velocity range to remove (i.e. inputting 15 will remove all notes with velocity values 0 to 15)
