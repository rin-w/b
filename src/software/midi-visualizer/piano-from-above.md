# Using *Piano From Above*
###### *For beginners, probably*
::: info 

Piano From Above by Brian Pantano is a visualizer and player for general
MIDIs.

:::

## Installation

#### Download {data-step="1"}

Currently, there are a few well-known sources to get a copy of PFA:
- [GitHub][gh1] (Windows, open-source, latest)
- [GitHub][gh2] (Windows, open-source, forked)

For the original version, open the first link on the list above, then select
the compatible executable file for your computer.

![github page for piano from above latest release](/pfa/dl.webp)

The red box in the photo above is where your options are. Select the one with
a green arrow if you have a modern day computer.

For the optimized version, open the second link on the list above.

![github page for piano from above forked release](/pfa/vizdl.webp)

You could simply download the only listed executable file as show in the red
box above. The latest version is what you will usually need as indicated in
the green box.

#### Run {data-step="2"}

For starters, you could simply just double click on the executable file you
downloaded.

![context menu to open piano from above](/pfa/open.webp)

Alternatively, you could select the file on your File Explorer window and
press Enter on your keyboard. If you can't find the Enter key on your
keyboard, consult your nearest technician/opthalmologist or buy a new
keyboard.

For more ways on how to run an executable file, type and search "how to open
files" on your favourite search engine like Google or Excavator.

Your first PFA launch should look something like this:

#### Patch (Optional) {data-step="3"}

If you will use OmniMIDI/Keppy's Synthesizer, you could apply a [WinMM patch](/software/synthesizer/keppy-synth#winmm-patch)
to PFA to increase synth playback performance.

Make sure to close PFA before applying the patch.


## Playing MIDI

You can play a MIDI by navigating the top bar buttons (a.k.a the menu):

![piano from above File menu](/pfa/openmidi.webp)

A new window will appear prompting you to select a MIDI file to play.

### Setting up the synthesizer

Simply open the `Preferences` window through the menu or press `Ctrl` + `P`

![piano from above preferences option from Options menu](/pfa/synth1.webp)

Then go to the `Audio` tab and select the synthesizer you want to use. 

![Audio tab of Preferences window showing recognized synthesizers of piano from above](/pfa/synth2.webp)

Click OK and it should take effect immediately (for most cases).

## Advanced Configuration

### Configuration file

The configuration file for PFA can be found in your `AppData` folder. To
quickly go there, just press `Win` + `R` to open the run box, then input
`"%appdata%\Piano From Above"`. 

Within it, the file that is named `Config.xml` can be opened using any text
editor (such as Notepad). 

::: tip
If you're not sure on how to open the file, just right-click on it and find on
the menu -> `Open with...` -> `Notepad`.
:::

::: warning
Before editing the file, make sure to close PFA first or else it will explode
(real).
:::

### 128 keys view

The forked viz version already has this option included in the preferences
window. 

For the original version, open the configuration file, then find the section
containing the string `<Visual ... >`. It will contain the two attributes we
need to modify, which is the `FirstKey` and `LastKey`. The former needs to be
set to `0` while the latter to `127`. The result after editing that line
should look something like this:

```xml
<Visual KeysShown="0" AlwaysShowControls="0" AssociateFiles="0" FirstKey="0" LastKey="127">
```

You can save the edited file afterwards, and start PFA again.

### Changing the startup MIDI

#### For viz

[PFAviz](#download) already features a setting for changing the startup MIDI.
Simply go to `Options` -> `Preferences` -> `Viz` tab -> `Browse` button under
`Splash MIDI`

#### For vanilla PFA

For this, we will need a virus (resource editor). You can download one from
here:

- [Resource Hacker][rh]

Once you open the app, you can target the PFA executable by heading to the
menu -> `File` -> `Open ...`, or just by dragging and dropping PFA's
executable file. 

![PFA on reshack about to get its resource modified](/pfa/reshack.webp)

Then, we need to look for resource 149, which is in the directory `MIDI` ->
`149 : 1033`. Right-click on it, then click `Replace Resource...`.

You can then pick the desired MIDI ~~(bad apple)~~ to play on PFA's startup
after you click on `[Select File...]`.

After selecting one, just click `[Replace]`. Then, the star should become red.
At this point, you can save the modifications by clicking the green floppy
disk.

## Troubleshoot

To close PFA fully, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Esc`, then find PFA in the list,
then click `[End Task]`.

### PFA is running but invisible

This bug has been fixed in the [pfaviz fork](#download).

::: details Steps to reproduce this bug 

- maximize the PFA window
- minimize it to taskbar
- right-click on it then click `Close window`
- run PFA again

:::

If you see it on the taskbar...

- hover on it, and wait for a mini view of PFA to appear
- right-click on the mini view
- on the menu, click `Maximize`
- close PFA
- run PFA again

### PFA doesn't run

If the previous steps didn't work, try resetting the [config file](#configuration-file).
Here's a video on how to do it:

#### Video Summary

- close PFA
- go to `"%appdata%\Piano From Above"`
- delete `Config.xml`
- run PFA again

Further stated in the video description is to move away huge MIDI files stored
in your library. The library also scopes these folders by default:

- `"%userprofile%\Desktop"`
- `"%userprofile%\Music"`
- `"%userprofile%\Documents"`
- `"%userprofile%\Music\Piano From Above"`
